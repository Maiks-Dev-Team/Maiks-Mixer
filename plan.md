# MaiksMixer UI Project Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for the C# user interface component of the MaiksMixer virtual audio mixer. The UI will provide a user-friendly interface for controlling the audio routing, mixing, and virtual device management functionality implemented in the C++ component.

## Project Goals

1. Create an intuitive, professional-looking audio mixer interface
2. Provide visual feedback for audio levels and routing
3. Allow users to easily configure and manage virtual audio devices
4. Communicate seamlessly with the C++ audio engine and drivers
5. Save and load user configurations

## Technical Stack

- **Language**: C# (.NET 6.0+)
- **UI Framework**: WinForms or WPF (to be decided)
- **Communication**: Named Pipes, Memory-Mapped Files, and C++/CLI Bridge
- **JSON Processing**: System.Text.Json
- **Audio Visualization**: Custom controls or third-party libraries

## Components to Build

### 1. Core Application Framework

- Main application window and layout
- System tray integration
- Configuration management (save/load settings)
- Application lifecycle management
- Logging and diagnostics

### 2. Communication Layer

- Implementation of the protocol defined in CommunicationProtocol.md
- Message serialization/deserialization
- Command dispatch system
- Event handling system
- Connection management and error recovery

### 3. Mixer UI Components

- Channel strips with faders, meters, and controls
- Routing matrix visualization and configuration
- Device management interface
- Visual level meters with peak and RMS display
- Mute/solo buttons and indicators

### 4. Device Management UI

- List and manage physical audio devices
- Create, configure, and remove virtual audio devices
- Device properties editor
- Status indicators for device health

### 5. Configuration UI

- Preset management (save, load, organize)
- Application settings
- Audio processing parameters
- Startup options

### 6. Custom Controls

- Audio level meters
- Faders and knobs
- Routing matrix visualization
- Connection status indicators

## Development Approach

### Phase 1: Framework and Communication

1. Set up basic application structure
2. Implement communication protocol with C++ component
3. Create mock audio engine for testing UI without C++ component
4. Build basic UI shell and navigation

### Phase 2: Core UI Components

1. Develop custom controls for audio visualization
2. Create channel strip components
3. Implement device management interface
4. Build routing matrix UI

### Phase 3: Integration and Polish

1. Connect UI to real C++ audio engine
2. Implement configuration saving/loading
3. Add system tray integration
4. Polish UI and improve responsiveness
5. Implement error handling and recovery

### Phase 4: Testing and Refinement

1. Test with various audio applications
2. Optimize UI performance
3. Refine user experience based on feedback
4. Add help documentation and tooltips

## UI Design Guidelines

- Use a dark theme suitable for audio applications
- Provide high contrast for important controls and indicators
- Ensure all controls are accessible via keyboard shortcuts
- Support different DPI settings and window sizes
- Use consistent visual language throughout the application

## Integration Points with C++ Component

- Device enumeration and creation/deletion
- Audio routing configuration
- Mixer control (volume, pan, mute, solo)
- Audio level metering
- Configuration management

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit tests for communication protocol
2. Mock audio engine for UI testing
3. Integration tests with C++ component
4. User acceptance testing with various audio applications

## Deployment Considerations

- Installer that handles both C# UI and C++ components
- Automatic updates
- Configuration migration between versions
- Windows permission handling for audio device creation

## Future Expansion

- Themes and customization
- MIDI control surface integration
- Plugin support for effects
- Advanced routing capabilities
- Remote control via network
